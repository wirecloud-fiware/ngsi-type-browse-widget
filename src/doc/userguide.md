## Introduction

The NGSI Type Browser widgets allows you to browser the entities types used in
a given [Orion Context
Broker](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker)
server in a easy and paginated way. This is done using the `contextTypes` querys, so
updates made into the context broker are not reflected immediately when using
this widget.

> Latest version of this widget is always provided in [FIWARE
> Lab](https://store.lab.fiware.org/search/keyword/OrionStarterKit) where you
> can make use of it on the [Mashup portal](https://mashup.lab.fiware.org).
> Remember to take a look into the example mashups provided in the OrionStarterKit offering.
